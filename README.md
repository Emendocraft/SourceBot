# SourceBot

If you want to install this bot you need to create a .env file after you downloaded it.
the .env File should contain following lines.
TOKEN=YOURDISCORDBOTTOKEN
GUILD=YOURGUILDID
WELCOMECHANNEL=YOURWELCOMECHANNELID

If you are completely new to this whole thing then go watch a tutorial on how to set up a "Discord.js V13 bot" first.

If you have any troubleshooting hit me up on Disccord. Emenegger#4556

You also need to consider changing the messages, that are sent. The bot really likes to swear, so if you don't want your bot to swear, then just edit the replys, etc.
